# Export voting results — Export disclosure differs from payload disclosure — WA

## Trigger

Export voting results request: Export disclosure differs from payload disclosure.

## Outcome

Export uses current votesPublic and does not replicate all retained-publicity payload protections; direct download has no additional closed-state guard.
