# Motion type delete is available to the configured administrators

Unrestricted CONSULTATION_SETTINGS marks only deletable types deleted.

Group entries are alternatives. Scope resolution tests the entry’s tag restriction first, otherwise agenda restriction, otherwise Motion-type restriction. A restricted entry does not pass an unrestricted (null-context) check. Applicable shipped group templates and installation administrator assignments participate as implemented.
