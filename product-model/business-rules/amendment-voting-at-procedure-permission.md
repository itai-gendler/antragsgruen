# Amendment voting at procedure is available to the configured administrators

Procedure assignment/grouping and voting-status fields use Limited procedure (scoped CHANGE_PROPOSALS or unrestricted CONSULTATION_SETTINGS); new inline ballots start Offline.

Group entries are alternatives. Scope resolution tests the entry’s tag restriction first, otherwise agenda restriction, otherwise Motion-type restriction. A restricted entry does not pass an unrestricted (null-context) check. Applicable shipped group templates and installation administrator assignments participate as implemented.
