# Motion edit admin text is available to the configured administrators

Administrative text saving requires scoped STATUS_EDIT and scoped TEXT_EDIT, after the editor-entry alternatives.

Group entries are alternatives. Scope resolution tests the entry’s tag restriction first, otherwise agenda restriction, otherwise Motion-type restriction. A restricted entry does not pass an unrestricted (null-context) check. Applicable shipped group templates and installation administrator assignments participate as implemented.
