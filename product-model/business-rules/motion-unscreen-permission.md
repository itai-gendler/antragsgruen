# Motion unscreen is available to the configured administrators

The list unscreen operation uses its actual contextual SCREENING check.

Group entries are alternatives. Scope resolution tests the entry’s tag restriction first, otherwise agenda restriction, otherwise Motion-type restriction. A restricted entry does not pass an unrestricted (null-context) check. Applicable shipped group templates and installation administrator assignments participate as implemented.
